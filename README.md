## Convolution Neural Network 
### Dataset 
"Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset of 10000 Images", downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images
- Data augmentation rotating images
### Layers
3 convolutional and four lineal layers.
- It use Cross Entropy for the loss function and Adam for the optimizer
- Calcul of the specificity, sensitivity, confusion matrix and accuracy.

You can save the model.

Accuracy of more than 90% in 10 epochs.
